This project is still under development, and the programs under "Final Programs" folder are different elements of it, which are not yet integrated together. 

F.A.I.R. Chance© is a computer vision application which can *detect, track, extract data related to range and speed* of the patient’s fine motor movements, estimate their movements, and appropriately provide feedback to the patient, all in real-time (or offline), through a single camera.

The user (patient) will need to place their *affected hand* in front of their computer's camera, ensuring the *entire hand is in frame* (from the tips of respective fingers to the base of the palm).
